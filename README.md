Hello metalheads!

My nick is Nintwarr because I like Nintendo and Warriors. I'm way too much imaginative, right?
As you may have noticed I like (power)metal but my favourite music is Celtic Music.
By the way, I hope some day C++ marries me some day. Java is flirting with me, I hope she doesn't succeed.
